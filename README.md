#### Week 4 Project - CSS

#### By **Rose Sponseller, June 16, 2017**

## Description

The objective of this assignment was to create a personal portfolio using Flexbox, Sass, and CSS animations and transitions. The result is not a complete site, but the skeleton of a personal portfolio -- it includes the structure of a personal portfolio, but the site consists of just filler content as of June 18, 2017. Watch this repo in the weeks to come :)
